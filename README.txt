This is a test project for microphone functionality. 

The project shows how to properly implement a microphone blueprint for Pixel Streaming.

The level provided runs as a voice recorder to record and playback the microphone input.

Open the blueprint provided "BP_AudioActor" Note how it uses Pixel Streaming Audio instead of the regular Audio Capture node to capture microphone input in Arcane Mirage Pixel Streaming platform.

For Pixel Streaming use Pixel Streaming Audio node in your project instead of regular Audio Capture.
